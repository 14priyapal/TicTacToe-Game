Create a classic Tic Tac Toe game where two players can take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The game interface should have a simple and intuitive design with a grid layout representing the Tic Tac Toe board. Players can click on empty squares to place their respective markers (X or O), and the game will automatically detect wins, ties, or continue until players decide to start a new game. Use HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic and interactivity.

Here are some key features to include:

Display the current player's turn (X or O).
Highlight the winning combination when a player wins.
Option to restart the game after a win or tie.
Display a message indicating the game outcome (win, tie, or ongoing).
Implementing these features will create a functional and enjoyable Tic Tac Toe game for players to enjoy!
